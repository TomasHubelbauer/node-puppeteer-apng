# Node Puppeteer APNG

A pure JavaScript Node library for recording a screencast of a webpage and
returning an animated PNG (APNG) file of the screencast. APNG is supported
in Firefox, Chrome, Safari and in the Chrome-based version of Edge. Also,
GitHub will play animated PNGs in readmes and other MarkDown documents, no
problem.
